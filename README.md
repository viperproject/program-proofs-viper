# Program Proofs in Viper
Examples and exercises from the book [*Program Proofs*](https://program-proofs.com/) by Rustan Leino translated and verified in [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html).

## Repository Structure
For each chapter of the book that we cover, we have a separate folder.
In each folder, there are two kinds of files depending on their names:
- files named `examples_X.Y.gobra` contain the examples from section `X.Y` of the book.
- files named `exercises_X.Y.gobra` contain the solutions to the exercises from section `X.Y`
  of the book, **not** the solution to exercise `X.Y`.

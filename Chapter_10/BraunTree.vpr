 /**
 * This ADT is the translation of the BraunTree created in the book.
 * The BraunTree is an ADT with two cases. Either it is an empty leaf,
 * or a Node. Each node consists of an Int value, as well as two BraunTrees.
 * In the book, they use 'type PQueue = BraunTree'. This is not possible in 
 * Viper. Therefore we will name the ADT PQueue immediately.
 * This will allow us to follow the book more closely.
